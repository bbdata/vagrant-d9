# Windows 10 Installation Steps

  1. Install Vagrant 2.2.9 and VirtualBox 6.0.22
     - Above versions seem to be the most stable for my Windows 10 environment without much fussing around with errors.
  2. cd into /vagrant folder and run 'vagrant up'

# Troubleshooting

## It appears your machine doesn't support NFS?

  Run 'vagrant plugin install vagrant-winnfsd'

## Failed to open/create the internal network 'HostInterfaceNetworking-VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter'
  
  1. Open Windows Network Connections
  2. Right click on VirtualBox Host only adapter that created
  3. Choose properties
  4. Check "VirtualBox NDIS6 Bridged Networking driver"
  5. disable and Enable the adapter

## Machine not booting up
